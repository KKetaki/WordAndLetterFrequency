Forty years ago, following the most intense and widespread urban disorder in 20th century Britain, the 
Times journalist Lucy Hodges and I co-wrote a book on the riots of 1981. In honour of Bob Marley, who 
died that spring, but also to try to convey the immensity of the events, we named the book after 
Marleyâ€™s final studio album: Uprising.
